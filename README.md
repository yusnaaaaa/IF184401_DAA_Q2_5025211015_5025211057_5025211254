## About
This document is the documentation for the `Tic Tac Toe Project`, which is part of the `Quiz 2 Project` for the `Design and Analysis of Algorithms Course`.

**Leveling :** 
- Level 1: Two Player Game
In this level, two players take turns placing X's and O's on the game board until someone wins or the game ends in a draw. The game board is displayed on the screen, and players input their moves via the command line.

- Level 2: Player vs Bot
In this level, the player goes up against a computer-controlled opponent. The player can choose to go first or second. If the player goes first, they input their moves via the command line as in Level 1. If the player goes second, the computer will make the first move, and subsequent moves are made by the player and the computer in turn.

- Level 3: Player vs AI (Unbeatable)
This level introduces an AI opponent that is more difficult to beat than the bot in Level 3. The AI opponent uses an algorithm called minimax to determine the best move to make based on the current state of the game board.

**How to play :** 
To play the game, select the desired level from the main menu. In Levels 1, players input their moves via the command line. In Levels 2 and 3, the game board is displayed on the screen, and players input their moves using the keyboard.

In Level 2 and 3, the player can choose to go first or second.

The game ends when a player wins or the game ends in a draw. Players can   choose to play again or exit the game after each match.
